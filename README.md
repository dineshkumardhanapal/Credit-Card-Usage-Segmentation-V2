Credit Card Usage Segmentation Develop comprehensive unsupervised learning models to accurately segment credit card customers based on their spending and payment behaviors. By utilizing these models, the institution aims to improve targeted marketing, risk assessment, and overall customer relationship management.

Project Overview:

This project focuses on developing unsupervised learning models for customer segmentation based on credit card usage data. The models aim to provide insights into distinct customer segments, improve credit risk assessment, and optimize marketing strategies. Deliverables include segmentation models, comprehensive data visualizations, and a comparative analysis of various algorithms.

Project Benefits:

Customer Insights: The models will help identify distinct customer segments, allowing for more personalized product offerings and services. Risk Management: Understanding spending patterns can assist in better credit risk assessment and fraud detection. Marketing Optimization: Segmentation can guide more effective and targeted marketing campaigns.

A set of unsupervised learning models designed for customer segmentation based on credit card usage data. Comprehensive data visualizations illustrating relationships between various financial features and customer segments. A comparative analysis of different unsupervised learning algorithms for the segmentation task.

Data Exploration: Conduct comprehensive EDA using visualization techniques to understand feature distributions and relationships within the credit card data. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, apply appropriate scaling techniques for numerical variables, and perform any necessary feature engineering. Dimensionality Reduction: Implement PCA and t-SNE for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D space. Model Selection: Evaluate unsupervised learning algorithm  K-Means.
