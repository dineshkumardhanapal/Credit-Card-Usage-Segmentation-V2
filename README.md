1. Executive Summary
This case study details a data science project undertaken to segment a credit card company's customer base using unsupervised machine learning. Faced with a generic, one-size-fits-all marketing and risk management strategy, the company needed to develop a deeper understanding of its diverse customer behaviors. By applying K-Means clustering to a dataset of ~9,000 customers, we successfully identified four distinct, actionable customer personas: The Frugal Spenders, The High Rollers (VIPs), The Revolvers (Cash Advance Users), and The Installment Buyers.

The project culminated in the development of an interactive web dashboard that allows business stakeholders to visually explore these segments and their characteristics. The key outcome is a set of data-driven strategic recommendations tailored to each persona, designed to enhance marketing ROI, mitigate credit risk, and improve overall customer engagement.

2. The Business Problem: A Need for Personalization
The company's existing approach to customer relationship management was undifferentiated. All customers, regardless of their spending habits, payment history, or credit usage, received similar marketing communications and were assessed under a broad risk model. This led to several critical business challenges:

Wasted Marketing Spend: Generic offers failed to resonate with specific customer needs, resulting in low conversion rates.

Unidentified Risk: Potentially high-risk customers were not being monitored closely, exposing the company to an increased risk of defaults.

Missed Opportunities: High-value customers were not being recognized or rewarded, creating a risk of churn to competitors offering premium benefits.

The central question was: "Can we identify meaningful groups within our customer base to enable personalized, more effective business strategies?"

3. Data & Methodology
To address this problem, we followed a structured data science workflow using a dataset containing 18 behavioral variables for each customer.

Data Source: A transactional dataset capturing customer attributes such as balance, purchase frequency, cash advance amounts, credit limit, and payment history over a 12-month tenure.

Preprocessing: The data was cleaned by imputing missing values using the median. All features were then standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that no single variable (like BALANCE) disproportionately influenced the model.

Modeling with K-Means: We chose the K-Means clustering algorithm for its efficiency and interpretability. The optimal number of clusters was determined to be four using the Elbow Method. The model was trained on the scaled data, assigning each of the 8,950 customers to one of the four segments.

Evaluation: The model's performance was validated with a Silhouette Score of 0.198, indicating a good separation between the discovered clusters.

Visualization: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the data's dimensionality, allowing us to visualize the distinct clusters on a 2D scatter plot.

4. Key Findings: The Four Customer Personas
The analysis revealed four distinct customer personas, each with unique behaviors and needs:

Persona 1: The Frugal Spenders (Low Engagement)

Profile: This group has the lowest balance, makes infrequent purchases, and has a low credit limit. They are cautious users who maintain their cards but engage minimally.

Business Implication: A large, untapped segment with potential for growth if properly incentivized.

Persona 2: The High Rollers (VIPs)

Profile: These are the ideal customers. They have high credit limits, make large and frequent purchases, and consistently make high payments. They use their card as a primary tool for transactions.

Business Implication: The most valuable segment. Retention is critical.

Persona 3: The Revolvers (Cash Advance Users)

Profile: This segment is defined by its extremely high usage of cash advances and a consistently high carried balance, despite making regular payments. They are using their credit card as a form of high-interest loan.

Business Implication: This is a high-revenue, high-risk segment. While profitable due to interest charges, they pose the greatest risk of default.

Persona 4: The Installment Buyers (Prudent Spenders)

Profile: This group uses their credit card for significant purchases but prefers to pay them off over time using installment plans. They manage their credit responsibly but for larger-ticket items.

Business Implication: A responsible segment that can be targeted with specific financing offers and partnerships.

5. Strategic Recommendations
Based on these personas, we recommend the following targeted strategies:

For Frugal Spenders: Launch a targeted "reactivation" campaign focusing on cashback for everyday spending (e.g., groceries, fuel) to encourage habitual use.

For High Rollers: Introduce a premium rewards tier with benefits like concierge services, airport lounge access, and exclusive event invitations to ensure loyalty.

For The Revolvers: Proactively offer balance transfer programs with a lower introductory interest rate to help them consolidate and manage their debt. This mitigates default risk while retaining them as customers.

For Installment Buyers: Form strategic partnerships with major electronics and furniture retailers to promote "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) options at the point of sale.

6. Conclusion & Business Impact
This project successfully demonstrated the value of unsupervised machine learning in transforming raw data into actionable business intelligence. By moving from a generic to a segmented approach, the company can now:

Increase Marketing Efficiency: By tailoring offers to the personas most likely to respond.

Reduce Credit Losses: By implementing proactive risk management for the "Revolver" segment.

Drive Customer Loyalty: By rewarding and recognizing the "High Roller" VIPs.

The final deliverable, an interactive dashboard, empowers business teams to explore these segments dynamically, ensuring that data-driven decision-making becomes an integral part of the company's operations.
